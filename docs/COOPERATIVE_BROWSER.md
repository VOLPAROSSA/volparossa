# Cooperative browser: real public peer execution

Status: implemented candidate; combined live KVM proof pending. Local pure fixture
checks are not a browser, model or network execution claim.

The public browser integration has a separate socket and panel from private local
compute. `ask(question, context)` prefills the panel only. Sending requires a supported
content license, rights confirmation and explicit public-content consent. Public input
and signed execution receipts remain in the owner's private task directory until the
owner removes it; peer cancellation is not a global-erasure guarantee.

The disposable `agent-cooperative-browser` scenario joins three actual components:

1. Exact-pinned Gecko ESR 140.16.0 and browser source
   `3c7894168ce6c1f28e96ce5b95bc99928e6c4304` drive the real public panel.
2. `compute public-serve` owns the signing identity and model/runtime configuration;
   the browser submits no paths, model code or signing keys.
3. Two real compatible peer workers execute signed public fragments and hierarchical
   synthesis over the existing protected WireGuard/MPTCP topology.

An independent root observer allows explicit UI submission only after proving prefill
created neither a task nor a peer worker. A public, literal README prefix is partitioned
using the pinned 135M tokenizer. The checker requires complete byte coverage, both peer
executors, at least two synthesis levels, original exact terminal receipts, observed
isolated workers and the hash of the final worker answer matching the browser display.
It then authorizes a second task, observes a live peer worker and permits scoped UI
cancellation. All observed processes must end before cleanup is reported.

The browser gets a loopback-only network namespace and read-only host view; only its
owned proof/profile roots are writable. The coordinator and workers stay under the
existing owner/privilege and protected-route boundaries. The fixture removes its
profiles, input, receipts, publisher identity, model/runtime copies and transient
services. Physical privacy captures and unchanged guest-host snapshots remain required.
The VM collector exports a closed set of bounded structural JSON, fixture/model/source
hashes and host-state evidence; raw prompts, answers, service logs and profiles are not
uploaded. Model answers may still be wrong: successful execution does not prove semantic
correctness, private peer inference, broad agent intelligence or full alpha completion.

Preview without mutation:

```sh
sh tests/integration/run-alpha-topology-vm.sh --preview --scenario agent-cooperative-browser
```

The GitHub alpha-topology workflow runs the real disposable scenario at its exact source
revision. Acceptance invokes `agent-cooperative-browser.py report REPORT SOURCE_SHA`;
missing consent, workers, native receipts, hierarchy, transport evidence or cleanup fail
the gate rather than silently substituting a fake service or local-only inference.
